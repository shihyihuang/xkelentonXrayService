- Title
  Xkeleton X-RAY Imaging Service
- Description
  Xkeleton X-RAY Imaging Service is a web application with the name 'Xkeleton,' a homophone of 'Skeleton.' It combines the 'X' from 'X-RAY' with 'Skeleton.' Additionally, the capital 'X' is shared with the subtitle 'X-RAY Imaging Service,' as seen in the logo below. This provides users with a clear understanding that we offer a specialized X-ray imaging service.

1. Visibility

   Each page displays only the necessary content, ensuring that buttons are visibly noticeable, making it clear to users what actions they should take to interact with the system.

2. Feedback

   Buttons change color when users hover over them, and the input field frame changes color when clicked, providing feedback to inform users about the input or action they are about to perform.

3. Affordance

   The calendar icon within the patient profile input field suggests its usage, prompting users to select a date from the calendar.

4. Mapping

   A vertical scroll bar appears when the page's content exceeds the limited screen space, indicating the user's current position. The page moves down in sync with the vertical bar's position, providing a consistent and predictable experience.

5. Constraints

   Users have the option to select a practitioner from a list rather than typing their name when making appointments. Similarly, practitioners can select a specific patient rather than typing their name when uploading images, reducing the chance of entering incorrect names.

6. Consistency

   The website maintains a consistent appearance across all pages. Buttons share the same style, and buttons with the same functionality are given the same color. For example, delete buttons are red, save buttons in the edit page are blue, and create and upload buttons on the index page are grey.
